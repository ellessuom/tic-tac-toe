## `npm start`
Runs the game in `localhost:8000`.  
The app will cache the progress of the game so stats won't be lost upon page reload.
 
## `npm test` 

| Number of tests | Number of Snapshots | Tests suites |
|---|---|---|
| 40 | 9 | 9 |
> **Tests are working locally with Node >14. HackerRank seems to fail and the issue seems to be related
